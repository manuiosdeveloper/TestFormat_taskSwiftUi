UI designed by Using SwiftUI
Design pattern MVVM
API - URLSession
Error Handlings
Reusable components
I have shown the data from API that you've given are 1.Title, 2. Description, 3.Price, 4.Rating, 5.Image....except these everything are static values

Note: - I have tried to match the UI that you've given sample UI screens...But I didn't find the exact icons and images of the sample UI so that i've used similer icons to match it.

Thanks for giving me this opportunity to showcase my talent...
